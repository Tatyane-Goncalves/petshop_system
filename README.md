# 🐾 PetShop System - OOP Practice Project in Python

## 🔥 Introduction
This is a simple **PetShop Management System**, built to help practice **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts using Python.
You’ll get your hands dirty with **classes**, **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, **encapsulation**, and **abstraction** in a fun and practical way.

## ✨ Features
- Register pet owners (tutors) and their pets 🧑🐶
- Differentiate between ``Dogs`` and ``Cats``
- Register services like bathing, grooming, and vaccination 💅
- Schedule services for pets 📅
- Display service schedules and history
- Simple terminal menu for user interaction

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Used

| Concept       | Where It’s Used                                     |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Encapsulation | Private attributes and access methods               |
| Inheritance   | `Dog` and `Cat` inherit from `Animal`               |
| Polymorphism  | `make_sound()` method behaves differently per class |
| Abstraction   | Abstract base class `Animal`                        |
